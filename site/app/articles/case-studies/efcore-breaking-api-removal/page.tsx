                The PR replaced parts of the Cosmos update pipeline that used
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> JObject</code>
                and <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded">JToken</code>
                with serialized byte payloads written through
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> Utf8JsonWriter</code>.
                It also marked
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> ContentResponseOnWriteEnabled()</code>
                obsolete because EF Core no longer benefits from the response body content.
              </p>
              <p>
                The largest compatibility question is not the public method being deleted. It is the
                shift from mutating a previously hydrated JSON document to serializing a fresh document
                from EF-tracked state.
              </p>
            </>
          ),
        },

              <p>
                Cosmos documents can contain fields that are not modeled by EF. Before this
                modernization, the pipeline could preserve unknown fields through the internal
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> __jObject</code>
                path. After the change, updates serialize the modeled entity state again. That is
                cleaner and faster, but it raises a silent data-loss question for applications that
                store extra JSON alongside EF-managed properties.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new obsolete attribute is also worth a reviewer stop. It tells users to stop using
                the API, but the message does not name a replacement because the intended migration is
                simply to remove the call.
              </p>

              <p>
                The earlier framing said this was a public API removal that would break every provider
                author. The verified diff is more nuanced: the direct public API change is an
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> [Obsolete]</code>
                annotation, while most signature churn is on EF-internal types that carry explicit
                internal-API disclaimers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The stronger case study is the behavioral one: a serialization pipeline rewrite can be
                correct and still deserve merge-gate attention because persisted JSON shape and
                unmapped-field preservation are production contracts.
