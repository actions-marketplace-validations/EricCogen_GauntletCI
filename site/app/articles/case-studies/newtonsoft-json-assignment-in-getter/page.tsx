                The pull request enabled nullable reference type annotations across the library. It
                changed fields, return types, method parameters, indexers, and test expectations in one
                broad migration. The PR body also called out two null-reference bugs discovered during
                the work: <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded">JToken.BeforeSelf()</code>
                and null XML node converter serialization.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most important reviewer signal is not a hidden getter mutation. It is the
                combination of public annotation changes and observable behavior changes in a library
                that millions of downstream projects compile against.
              </p>

              <p>
                Nullable annotations are source-compatible at runtime, but they are still an API
                contract. A return type moving from non-nullable to nullable changes compiler warnings
                for consumers in nullable-aware projects. That can break warning-as-error builds even
                when binaries continue to load.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded">BeforeSelf()</code>
                fix is a good behavioral change: parentless tokens now return an empty sequence instead
                of throwing. But it is still externally observable behavior and deserves a regression
                test, which the PR added.
              </p>
            </>

              <p>
                The old case-study framing said this PR added an assignment inside a property getter.
                The verified diff does not support that. The relevant getter change was
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> return _content._token!;</code>,
                which is a null-forgiving annotation, not a mutation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Correcting that premise makes the case study stronger: it shows that high-quality case
                studies should explain the actual risk, even when that means replacing a more dramatic
                but inaccurate claim.
