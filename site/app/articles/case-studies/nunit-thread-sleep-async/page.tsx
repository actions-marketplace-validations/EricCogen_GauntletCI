              <p>
                PR #5192 was a release/4.6 merge to main. Among platform filter updates and framework
                additions, two attribute declarations changed
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> Inherited = false</code>
                to
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> Inherited = true</code>:
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> CancelAfterAttribute</code>
                and
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> TimeoutAttribute</code>.
              </p>
              <p>
                That means derived fixtures can begin inheriting cancellation or timeout behavior from
                a base class. The change may be correct, but it is externally observable for any test
                suite that depends on NUnit inheritance behavior.
              </p>
            </>
          ),
        },
        {

          children: (
            <>
              <p>
                Timeout and cancellation metadata controls execution, not just documentation. A base
                fixture decorated with
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> [CancelAfter]</code>
                can now change the runtime behavior of every derived test. Long-running async tests may
                start receiving cancellation that they previously ignored.
              </p>
              <p>
                The diff is deceptively small. A reviewer scanning for blocking calls will not see
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> Thread.Sleep</code>
                or
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> .Wait()</code>.
                The risk is encoded in attribute metadata.
              </p>

            <>
              <p>
                The old page claimed PR #5192 introduced
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> Thread.Sleep</code>
                and static mutable state. The verified diff does not support that. The closest file
                uses an existing
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> AutoResetEvent.WaitOne()</code>
                pattern in tests, not a newly added sleep.
              </p>
              <p>
                Keeping this as a case study is still useful if it is framed honestly: it documents a
                rule-design gap and a class of behavior change that deserves a future detector.
