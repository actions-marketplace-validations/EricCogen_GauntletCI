                The pull request introduced keyspace notifications and multi-node subscription
                management. Two sibling classes implement the same cleanup method:
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> RemoveDisconnectedEndpoints()</code>.
                Single-node mode clears the server when the subscriber is <em>not</em> connected.
                Multi-node mode was supposed to do the equivalent sweep across servers, but the added
                condition kept endpoints when <code className="font-mono text-sm">IsSubscriberConnected</code> was
                true — the opposite polarity.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a classic copy/paste drift pattern: the method names match, the surrounding
                feature work is correct, and the bug is one negation away from the reference
                implementation.
              </p>

            <>
              <p>
                Wrong endpoint cleanup in a Redis client does not fail loudly at compile time. Under
                cluster failover or partial disconnects, the library may retain stale server entries
                or drop live ones. Pub/sub routing becomes nondeterministic relative to connection
                state, and application code still sees a healthy multiplexer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Greptile and Qodo surfaced this defect in eval-lab runs. GauntletCI originally
                missed it while emitting dozens of lower-signal findings on the same large diff.

              <p>
                Rule GCI0058 compares sibling classes in the same diff: same method
                name, same boolean predicate, opposite polarity. It is deterministic (not LLM-judged)
                and fires on property patterns like
                <code className="font-mono text-sm"> IsSubscriberConnected: false</code> versus
                <code className="font-mono text-sm"> .IsSubscriberConnected</code> without a dedicated
                Redis hardcode.
              </p>
              <p>
                Platform phases PG-DELIVERY and PG-DOMAIN cap noise on library profiles so this
                finding survives delivery instead of being buried under per-line fanout.

                Reviewers anchor on the new public API and cluster tests. The bug sits in parallel
                internal classes that look intentionally symmetric. Without cross-class comparison,
                the added lines read like reasonable null/state checks rather than an inversion.
