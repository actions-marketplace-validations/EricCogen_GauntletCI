                The pull request was primarily about keyspace notifications: new APIs, cluster routing,
                and supporting infrastructure. It was not an exception-handling PR. The relevant file,
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> ChannelMessageQueue.cs</code>,
                was restructured as part of the work, so pre-existing handler logic appeared as new
                lines in the diff.
              </p>
              <p>
                That matters because diff-based review operates on what the reviewer sees in the PR. A
                carried-forward catch block can still be the right time to ask whether the behavior is
                acceptable, especially when the surrounding feature changes how messages are delivered.

                The affected code invokes user-provided synchronous and asynchronous message handlers.
                If a handler throws while processing a Redis pub/sub message or cache-invalidation
                notification, the exception is swallowed and the loop continues. There is no log, no
                metric, and no callback to tell the application that its handler failed.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a cache-invalidation path, that can leave stale application state behind while the
                Redis connection still looks healthy. Operators see a quiet system, not a failing one.
              </p>
            </>

              <p>
                The PR was large and feature-heavy. Review attention naturally goes to the new
                keyspace-notification API, cluster routing, and test coverage. The catch blocks are
                short, visually familiar, and accompanied by a comment saying they match another type.
              </p>
              <p>
                That comment explains intent, but it does not provide operational visibility. GauntletCI
                turns the one-line swallow into a specific review question: is silent handler failure
                still the desired contract for this new message-delivery surface?
