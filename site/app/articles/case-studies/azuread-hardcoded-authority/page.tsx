              <p>
                The PR introduced telemetry tracking for JWT and SAML signature validation. It records
                dimensions such as library version, token algorithm, key algorithm, issuer bucket, and
                validation error. To do that, several validation paths were refactored from static
                helpers toward instance methods that can access a telemetry client.
              </p>
              <p>
                The issuer dimension is intentionally controlled by
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> CryptoTelemetry.TrackedIssuers</code>.
                Hosts not on the allowlist are reported as
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> other</code>
                to avoid unbounded metric-cardinality growth.
              </p>
            </>
          ),
        },
        {
          title: "Why this is risky",
          children: (
            <>
              <p>
                Signature validation is a security-critical path. Even when telemetry is meant to be
                observational, threading a telemetry client through validation changes call shape,
                exception paths, and performance characteristics. Reviewers need to confirm that
                failures still fail closed and that success/failure semantics do not change.
              </p>
              <p>
                Telemetry dimensions also become production contracts. If issuer values are not tightly
                bucketed, a validation endpoint can generate high-cardinality metrics or accidentally
                expose arbitrary tenant/issuer hostnames to downstream telemetry systems.
              </p>
            </>
          ),
        },

            <>
              <p>
                The old case study said the PR introduced a hardcoded
                <code className="font-mono text-sm text-foreground/80 bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded"> login.microsoftonline.com</code>
                authority URL in production validation code. The verified PR does not support that.
                The string appears as an issuer-host example in telemetry documentation, not as a
                production authority override.
              </p>
              <p>
                The accurate case study is still valuable: it shows how observability work in a
                cryptographic validation path should be reviewed for semantic preservation, privacy,
                performance, and cardinality.
