              Breaking changes in .NET code are often invisible at compile time. The compiler
              says green. The tests pass. Production fails the moment the first real request hits
              the changed code path. This article explains why that gap exists, what the most
              common breaking change patterns look like, and how GauntletCI closes the gap

              The .NET compiler catches type errors and missing references within a project or
              solution. It does not verify runtime contracts. A method signature change may
              compile successfully if all call sites within the repository are updated, but
              external consumers, serialized payloads in databases or message queues, and
              dynamically resolved services have no compile-time check at all.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The compiler operates on source. The runtime operates on binaries. When a library
              assembly is updated and deployed without recompiling every consumer, the compiler
              had no opportunity to raise an error for the consumer assemblies that still carry
              metadata pointing at the old method signature. The first runtime call to the
              changed or removed method produces a MissingMethodException or TypeLoadException
              that no amount of static analysis on the library alone could have predicted.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              These are not rare edge cases. They are the normal state of any system with more
              than one service, any persistence layer, or any public API surface. The compiler
              success guarantee is narrow. The runtime failure surface is wide. This gap: the
              delta between what the compiler checks within the solution boundary and what the
              runtime encounters across all consumers: is The Compiler&apos;s Blind Spot.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight">Why semantic versioning does not prevent runtime breaking changes</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Semantic versioning is a communication protocol, not an enforcement mechanism. A
              library author who increments the major version correctly has communicated that
              something breaking changed. The downstream consumer who has not yet updated their
              code still gets a runtime failure the moment they update the package reference
              without reading the changelog.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              More importantly, semver requires the library author to know which changes are
              breaking in the first place. Research by Dig and Johnson found that 80 percent of
              the 147 breaking API changes they studied across open source Java projects were
              caused by refactoring: changes the author considered routine cleanup rather than
              intentional API evolution{" "}
              <a href="#cite-1" className="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 text-xs align-super font-mono">[1]</a>
              . The study examined open-source Java projects; no large-scale .NET-specific dataset
              substantially contradicts the proportion, though the precise rate likely varies by
              ecosystem and project type. A developer who renames a method during a refactor
              sprint is unlikely to reach for the changelog before committing. Semver provides
              no signal until after the commit is merged and the package is published.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The intent gap matters here. The developer who renamed that method was not
              negligent: they were doing their job. The build passed, the tests passed, the
              linter was clean. The breaking change was an unintended side effect of a correct,
              intentional action. A pre-commit structural check is designed for exactly this
              case: flagging the unintended consequence before the developer has moved on.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The cost of discovering a breaking change at the consumeris higher than the cost
              of preventing it at the author. Hora et al. measured how downstream projects
              reacted when their library dependencies introduced breaking changes and found that
              many projects simply stopped updating the dependency, accumulating security and
              correctness debt rather than absorbing the migration cost{" "}
              <a href="#cite-2" className="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 text-xs align-super font-mono">[2]</a>
              . The practical
              implication is that library authors who introduce unintentional breaking changes do
              not just cause immediate runtime failures; they cause long-term ecosystem
              fragmentation. Pre-commit detection converts this class of problem from an
              ecosystem-level event into a single-developer edit.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              In a .NET solution with multiple projects, the build system ensures every project
              within the solution compiles against the current source. When project A references
              project B, and a developer changes a public method in B, the build fails at project
              A immediately. This is the happy path. It is also the narrowest case.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The multi-assembly problem appears in three common real-world shapes:

                  that accept floating version ranges and update the package will get a
                  binary that no longer matches the signatures their code was compiled against.
                  The result is a MissingMethodException or BadImageFormatException at the

                  the plugins when the host API changes. The failure surface is entirely in the
                  runtime layer, and it typically surfaces in production long after the host
                  was updated.

                  in one service does not cause a compile error in the other, even if both
                  services live in the same repository. The failure appears at runtime when a
                  payload of the old shape arrives at a deserializer expecting the new shape,

                A <em>binary-incompatible change</em> allows consumer code to compile against the old

                only when the updated library is loaded and a method or type that no longer exists is
                called. Most consumer-visible breaking changes in the wild are binary-incompatible.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The .NET ecosystem provides several well-documented examples of breaking changes
              that caused significant migration effort across the community. Each one follows the
              same pattern: correct compilation, runtime failure, delayed discovery.

              <strong className="text-foreground">Newtonsoft.Json to System.Text.Json.</strong>{" "}
              When Microsoft introduced System.Text.Json as the default serializer in ASP.NET
              Core 3.0, teams that migrated from Newtonsoft.Json encountered serialization
              contract breaks that were invisible at compile time. Newtonsoft serializes public
              fields by default; System.Text.Json does not. Newtonsoft performs case-insensitive
              property matching by default; System.Text.Json requires explicit configuration for
              the same behavior. Properties decorated with [JsonProperty] from Newtonsoft were
              silently ignored by the new serializer, causing wire format changes that surfaced
              only when stored payloads were read back or when downstream services that had not
              yet migrated received responses in the new format. None of these differences
              produced compile-time errors.

              <strong className="text-foreground">Entity Framework Core 6 to 7.</strong>{" "}
              EF Core 7 introduced breaking changes to how owned entity types are mapped to
              tables. Applications that relied on the previous behavior compiled without
              modification but produced different SQL at runtime. In some cases the queries
              returned wrong data rather than throwing an exception, which is the hardest
              failure mode to detect in automated testing. The EF Core team documented these
              changes in their migration guide, but developers who upgraded the package without
              reading the guide had no automated signal that behavior had changed.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              <strong className="text-foreground">AutoMapper major versions.</strong>{" "}
              AutoMapper removed its static API in version 9.0. Applications using the static
              API compiled against version 8.x would fail to compile against 9.x, but those
              that had already compiled and were running against 8.x would break only when the
              package version was updated and the host restarted. Teams running integration
              tests against the actual binary rather than recompiling from source would not
              catch the failure until deployment. The pattern repeats across the ecosystem

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Finding a breaking change in post-deploy monitoring means a rollback, an incident,
              and a post-mortem. Finding it in code review means a comment and a revision.
              Finding it before the commit is created means a fix before anyone else is
              involved.

              Static analysis scoped to the staged diff rather than the entire codebase
              delivers feedback at the only moment when the cost of a fix is minimal: before
              the commit exists. The analysis surface is bounded by the size of the commit, so
              the check completes in milliseconds regardless of codebase size. GauntletCI
              implements this model with deterministic structural rules: every public API
              removal, every serialization contract break, and every unsafe concurrency pattern
              in the diff produces a finding on every run.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Determinism is what separates structural rules from probabilistic analysis. A
              tool that produces inconsistent results trains developers to dismiss findings as
              noise. A structural rule that fires every time a public method is removed without
              a replacement overload carries no false-negative rate for that pattern. Developers
              quickly learn which finding types require mandatory action and which allow
              deliberate acknowledgment, and that distinction preserves the signal value of
              every finding the tool produces.
