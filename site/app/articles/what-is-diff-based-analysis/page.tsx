              What is diff-based analysis?
            </h1>
            <p className="text-xl text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-pretty">
              Diff-based analysis examines only the lines you changed, not the entire codebase.
              It answers the question: &quot;What risk did this change introduce?&quot; rather than
              &quot;What risk exists in the whole project?&quot;
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              This distinction is not cosmetic. The scope of what a tool analyzes determines who
              uses it, how often, and whether its findings get acted on. Decades of research on
              static analysis adoption tell a consistent story: developers abandon tools that cry
              wolf, and they keep using tools that surface only what matters right now. Diff-based
              analysis is the structural answer to that adoption problem.

              <code className="text-xs font-mono bg-card border border-border rounded px-1.5 py-0.5">git add</code>,
              Git records a diff: the exact lines added, modified, and removed. A diff-based
              analysis engine operates on this diff as its sole input. It does
              not load, parse, or scan any file that was not touched by the current changeset.
              Every finding the tool produces is directly traceable to a line in the current diff.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The engine reads each changed hunk, identifies the structural role of the modified
              lines (is this a guard clause? a public method signature? a serialization attribute?
              a dependency injection registration?), and evaluates a set of targeted rules against
              those structural properties. Critically, each rule fires on the delta (the change
              itself), not on the surrounding stable code that has been in production for months.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The example below shows a single-line deletion. A guard clause that validated the

              for structural reasons. A full-codebase scanner may or may not surface this
              depending on whether it has a rule for missing input validation. A diff-based scanner
              surfaces it immediately because it can see the deletion (the removed line) and
              knows what was there before.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight">
              The false positive problem: why developers abandon full-codebase scanners
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              A 2013 study published at the International Conference on Software Engineering
              examined why developers do not use static analysis tools even when those tools are
              available <a href="#cite-1" className="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 text-xs align-super font-mono">[1]</a>. The top-ranked reason was false positives, ahead of
              performance, installation friction, and IDE integration gaps. Developers who encounter
              a tool that fires on pre-existing, known-benign patterns quickly learn to ignore it.
              Once a tool trains developers to ignore it, it has negative utility: it adds
              cognitive load with no corresponding benefit. Studies examining different tool types
              and organizational contexts identify performance overhead and integration friction as
              additional significant barriers, though false positives rank consistently near the top.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Google observed the same dynamic at scale. In their 2018 Communications of the ACM
              paper on lessons from building static analysis tools across the full Google codebase,
              the authors describe how they deliberately ship only checks where confidence is very
              high <a href="#cite-2" className="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 text-xs align-super font-mono">[2]</a>. Their internal tools were not rejected because they were slow or hard to
              install. They were rejected when the signal-to-noise ratio dropped below the
              threshold where a developer found it worth reading findings at all. The team
              eventually required that any new check demonstrate a low false positive rate on
              existing code before it could be turned on.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Full-codebase scanning amplifies the false positive problem structurally. Every scan
              re-reports the same issues that were in the codebase before the developer touched
              anything. Technical debt accumulated years ago floods the results. A developer who
              changed two lines in one file sees hundreds of findings across the project, none of
              which are things they introduced and most of which their team has already decided to
              defer.The tool is technically correct, but it is not useful for the task the
              developer is actually doing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Beller et al. evaluated static analysis adoption in open source projects and found
              that even teams that had integrated static analysis into their CI pipelines frequently
              disabled or silenced large categories of warnings over time <a href="#cite-3" className="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 text-xs align-super font-mono">[3]</a>. The pattern
              is predictable enough to have a name: the tool abandonment cycle. A team adopts a
              scanner, the finding count grows, developers start suppressing rules, and eventually
              the tool runs silently in CI producing output nobody reads. Each step is rational in
              isolation; the cumulative outcome is a tool that provides negative value.Teams that maintain sustained adoption typically roll out rule sets
              incrementally rather than enabling all checks at once; adoption patterns vary
              significantly by team size and codebase maturity.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Diff-based analysis sidesteps this failure mode by construction. Because it only
              analyzes what changed, the maximum finding count for any given commit is bounded by
              the size of the diff. A two-line change produces at most a small number of findings,
              and every one of those findings is about the two lines the developer just wrote.
              There is no accumulated backlog of pre-existing issues competing for attention.

              Signal-to-noise ratio: the metric that determines whether developers trust a tool
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The practical measure of a static analysis tool is not its recall rate on a test
              suite of known bugs. It is whether a developer, in the middle of shipping a feature,
              stops what they are doing and acts on a finding. That behavior requires trust, and
              trust requires a track record of findings that were worth acting on.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the fraction of tool findings that represent genuine,
              actionable risk versus total findings. A tool with high recall but low SNR produces
              many true positives alongside many false positives. Because developers cannot cheaply
              distinguish which is which (doing so would require the analysis they were hoping
              the tool would do for them), they treat all findings as suspect and eventually treat
              all findings as ignorable.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Ayewah et al. studied false positive rates in FindBugs (now SpotBugs) deployments
              and found that false positive rates varied enormously by rule category <a href="#cite-4" className="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 text-xs align-super font-mono">[4]</a>. Some rule
              categories were nearly always correct. Others fired on benign patterns more often than
              not. The practical lesson was not to tune the rules in isolation but to restrict which
              rules run in which contexts: a finding that is 40% likely to be a false positive
              in a full-codebase scan may be 90% likely to be a true positive when scoped to lines
              that were just modified. More recent tooling has reduced false positive rates in some
              categories; the core finding that context governs precision remains consistent.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Rules scoped to the diff context fire only when a problem is introduced by the
              current change. A rule about removing a guard clause fires when a guard clause is
              removed in the current diff; it does not fire when a guard clause is absent from a
              stable file that has been in production for two years and whose absence was a
              deliberate design decision. The same rule logic, applied at different scope,
              produces radically different SNR. Scoping rules to the delta rather than the full
              file is the primary mechanism by which diff-based analysis achieves a higher SNR
              than equivalent rules running over a full codebase.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              High SNR has a compounding benefit. When a developer acts on every finding they
              receive, the tool becomes part of their normal workflow. They do not develop the
              habit of dismissing findings without reading them. This means that when a genuinely
              critical finding appears (a removed authentication check, a hardcoded secret, a
              <Link href="/detect-breaking-changes-before-merge" className="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 underline underline-offset-2">broken serialization contract</Link>) it gets the same attention every other finding
              receives, rather than being lost in a backlog of noise.

              boundary. In the third pass it classifies each line within a hunk as a context line,
              an added line, or a removed line, and records the original and new line numbers using
              the hunk header coordinates.

              shown in the new file. The format is{" "}

              from the new file starting at line 38. The two-line reduction is the deleted guard
              clause: two removed lines, no replaced lines.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              After parsing, each rule receives a structured representation: a list of changed
              hunks, each containing typed line objects with their content, their old and new line
              numbers, and their change type (added, removed, or context). Rules do not do any text
              parsing of their own. They pattern-match against the structured representation. A rule
              that looks for removed guard clauses queries: in any hunk, is there a sequence of
              removed lines that matches the pattern of a guard clause (a conditional followed by
              a throw or early return) at the top of a method body? If yes, fire. If no, move on.
              The rule never reads the surrounding file.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Context lines are included in the hunk representation but are never the subject of a
              finding. Their purpose is to give rules enough surrounding code to make a structural
              judgment. A removed line that looks like a throw statement is more clearly a guard
              clause if the context lines confirm it was inside an if block near the top of a
              method. Context lines provide that framing without expanding the scope of what the
              engine analyzes to the full file. Typically three lines of context are provided on
              each side of a changed block, which is the default for unified diffs and is
              sufficient for most structural pattern matching.

              Integration points: where diff-based analysis fits in the development workflow
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Analysis tools can run at several points in the development lifecycle. Each
              integration point has different characteristics for feedback latency, developer
              context, and cost of remediation. Diff-based analysis is well-suited to the earliest
              integration points precisely because it operates on diffs; a diff is always
              available as long as there are staged or unstaged changes.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Pre-commit</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Pre-commit is the earliest integration point. The developer has just finished writing
              code and is about to record a snapshot. The diff is the exact set of changes they
              intend to commit. Running analysis here means the developer receives findings before
              the change becomes part of repository history. Fixing a finding is a file edit: no
              branch, no PR, no review cycle required. The cost is measured in seconds.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Pre-commit hooks also run locally, which means no network round trip and no CI
              queue wait. GauntletCI is designed to complete analysis in under one second on a
              typical diff, making it fast enough to run on every commit without disrupting
              developer flow. The hook receives the staged diff directly from Git and returns
              structured findings before the commit object is created.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">CI pipeline (pre-merge)</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Running diff-based analysis in CI, against the PR diff, is the second natural
              integration point. At this stage the developer has already committed and pushed.
              The diff is still well-defined (the branch diff against main), but the cost of
              fixing a finding is higher: a new commit, a push, and a re-run of CI. The developer
              may have context-switched to other work. Feedback latency is minutes to tens of
              minutes depending on queue depth.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              CI is a good fallback for teams that cannot or do not enforce pre-commit hooks
              uniformly. It also serves as a hard gate when team policy requires all findings to
              be clear before merge, regardless of whether the developer ran the hook locally.
              Running the same GauntletCI binary in CI that runs locally ensures consistent
              findings across both environments.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">IDE and editor integration</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Some teams run analysis on save or on file change within the editor. This is the
              fastest feedback loop possible: sub-second latency, with findings surfaced inline
              while the code is still on screen. GauntletCI can be invoked with a diff piped from
              the editor change buffer, making real-time IDE integration achievable. The tradeoff
              is that partial changes (code that is syntactically incomplete or not yet compiling)
              can produce noisy results. Many teams use IDE integration for advisory findings
              and pre-commit integration for hard gates that block the commit.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight">The economics of early detection</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The cost of a defect is not fixed. It scales with the distance between when the
              defect was introduced and when it is detected. A guard clause removed in a
              pre-commit change is a two-second fix: restore the line, stage it again, re-run the
              hook. The same guard clause removal found in code review requires a PR comment
              thread, a context switch back to the code, a new commit, a push, and a re-review
              pass. Found after deploy, it is a production incident with a rollback, an on-call
              page, and a postmortem.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              This is not a theoretical claim. Research on defect cost amplification going back to
              the 1970s consistently finds that the cost ratio between detecting a defect early in
              development versus in production can be 10:1 to 100:1 or higher depending on the
              severity and the system involved. Pre-commit detection is not quite design time, but
              it is the closest practical analog in a modern commit-based workflow. The developer
              still has the change in working memory, the editor is open, and no other person time
              has been spent yet.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Diff-based analysis is uniquely positioned to deliver pre-commit feedback because
              its input is the diff: exactly what the pre-commit hook has available. There
              is no need to check out the full repository, run a build, or wait for a CI
              environment. The staged diff is available immediately, and the analysis completes
              before the commit is finalized.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Code review, even when thorough, is a probabilistic gate. Reviewers miss things,

              diff size, or social pressure to approve quickly.

            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Full-codebase scanning tools like SonarQube, Semgrep, and CodeQL serve a different
              purpose: finding existing issues across the full codebase on a schedule. A diff-based
              pre-commit tool does not replace them; it adds a pre-commit gate that flags the risk
              introduced by the current change before that risk becomes part of the baseline the
              scanner has to manage. Running both approaches provides defense in depth: new risk is
              caught at the earliest possible moment, and existing risk is tracked over time with a
              dedicated tool suited to that task.

              For teams migrating to a scanner from a codebase with no prior analysis, diff-based
              tooling also offers a practical migration path. Rather than being confronted with
              thousands of pre-existing findings on day one, the team can freeze the existing
              baseline and use diff-based analysis to ensure no new issues are introduced going
              forward. Technical debt is addressed incrementally without blocking current work.
