# GauntletCI Rule Catalog

GauntletCI rules detect risk introduced by code changes.

A finding is not a claim that the code is definitely broken. A finding is evidence that the diff introduced behavior worth validating.

## Rule status

- **Stable**: suitable for normal use
- **Beta**: useful but still being tuned
- **Experimental**: may produce more false positives

## Best Practices Guide

Beyond deterministic risk detection, GauntletCI includes a **[Best Practices Guide](../best-practices.md)** covering 30 patterns for C# code quality across 14 categories:

- **Naming** (clarity and convention)
- **Control Flow** (readability)
- **Exception Handling** (reliability)
- **Async Patterns** (safety)
- **Collections** (performance and correctness)
- **Security** (protection against known vectors)
- **API Design** (usability and encapsulation)
- **Testing** (regression prevention)
- **And 6 more...**

Best practices are *advisory by default* and complement the deterministic GCI rules, which focus on behavioral safety and correctness.
